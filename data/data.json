[{"name":"Dawg Coffee","desc":"One of the most common web development projects is a homepage for an organization or product. Most every organization and product has one, and it's amazing how many of them are really terrible, especially on small mobile device screens. This is a shame because it's just not that hard to build a well-designed, responsive marketing site. For this project I will build one of these sites for a fictitious coffee shop named Dawg Coffee. This site will respond to the size of screen it is rendered on, and adjust its layout and styling accordingly.","image":"\portfolio\img\DawgCoffeThumb.jpg","url":"http://students.washington.edu/hiiamhuy/info343/dawg-coffee/"},
{"name":"Police Shooting","desc":"Web development skills don't just allow you to create slick web pages -- they enable you to communicate important information to broad audiences. In this exercise, I'll create an interactive map of the crowdsourced police shootings data that was crowdsourced from Deadspin last fall. This project will implement a new Javascript library Leaflet.js to create an interactive map.","image":"\portfolio\img\PoliceShootingThumb.jpg","url":"http://students.washington.edu/hiiamhuy/info343/police-shooting/"},
